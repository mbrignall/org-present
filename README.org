This is an example of how I do presentations using org-re-reveal and a few other bonus features like Chalkboard and neat
css.

** Features

Styled presentation, simple navigation and IMO all the plugins you'd need to do a successful presentation. I wanted to
use Emacs for creating my slides and have a seamless way of creating feature rich presentations without major effort.

Requirements:

- Keyboard driven workflow (navigation, commands, navigation)
- Code, quotes, links and images rendered
- Flexibility in layout and navigation
- Speaker notes and upcoming slide view
- Chalkboard for drawing on slides, highlighting points
- Single command publish

* What you'll need

Firstly you'll need:

[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/org-re-reveal][Org Re-Reveal GitHub Repo]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-re-reveal
  :straight nil
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/org-re-reveal/")
#+end_src

and for general information and features available with Org Reveal please go [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][here]].

* What's in the folders

#+begin_src 
+-- .dir-locals.el (setup script)
+-- content
|   +-- example.org (main content)
|   +-- notes-style.setup (notes setup - not used)
|   +-- reveal.org (main setup file)
|   +-- revealjs-plugins-conf.js (plugins)
+-- public
|   +-- themes/css
|   |   ---+ custom.css (notes css)
|   |   ---+ styles.css  (main css)
|   +-- example.html (output file)
#+end_src

** Main setup files

*** ~.dir-locals.el~

This elisp file is mainly used for the ~revealjs-plugins-conf.js~ inclusion. I borrowed this file
example from another repo but cannot remember where at this time. The other functions are for managing images using
base64 which is neat but may not be required in every circumstance. I'll let you decide but without it the JS plugins
won't work.

*** ~example.org~

Your main content

*** ~notes-style.setup~

This is not currently used

*** ~content/example.org~

Example org file - adjust as needed.

*** ~reveal.org~

This is where all the features and styles are defined, I've left notes along the way and they're all remote/cdn where
possible to make the project very portable. The only local file is the ~public/themes/css/styles.css~ which styles the
slides to my preference.

In this file you can also turn on or off plugins, set the default width, reveal.js version and root (cdn).

*** ~public/example.html~

Output of running the command ~M-x org-re-reveal-export-to-html-and-browse~ this should create the example.html file and
open a default browser tab showing the contents.
